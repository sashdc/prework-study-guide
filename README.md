# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description

The prework study guide webpage served as a hands on way to enter into the world of coding by using each of the tools in basic ways to better understand them and be less intimidated by them.

It includes use of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and of course GitHub.

The finished product may not be great but it took many educational steps to get to it and is but a bulding block.
